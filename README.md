# BP Tutoring Platform

* Frontend code resides in `client`
* Backend code resides in `server`
* Setup instructions are located in the `README.md` files in each folder.
- Don't install dependencies to the base directory! Frontend dependencies should be separately installed into the `client` folder and backend dependencies should be separately installed into the `server` folder
